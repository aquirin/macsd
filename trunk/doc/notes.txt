Hello Arnaud,

Glad to meet you finally!

I'm working on two separate problems: shapes and go. Each have different
implementations (can't handle heredity well with c++).

The first one (shapes) uses the same input as subdue, but with the
restrictions that the edges (e.g., d 1 2) must be given in a consecutive
order, that is, "d 1 2", "d 2 3" and "d 3 4", the order "d 1 2", "d 3 4" and
"d 2 3" is not valid since the edge 3-4 those not originates from either 1 or 2.

The second one (go) is an ontology set with a given hierarchy. It has a custom
format file, I don't think it's gonna be good for your application... I'm
having some trouble with this, since the pheromone matrix is huge!
(18695x18695). I'm trying to store the matrix differently and it's driving me
crazy since I have to change a lot of code.

While I'm working on the go problem, I send you a beta release ;) of the
shapes implementation so you can get used to the code. It's quite short so its
attached to this mail.

You probably have to make several changes since I'm maximizing the function,
so you'll have to change the pheromone update and the dominance formula.

To compile:

g++ -g -c shapes.cpp
g++ -g -c hormigas.cpp
g++ -g -c NDominatedSet.cpp
g++ -g -c macs.cpp
g++ -g -c main.cpp
g++ -g -c aco.cpp
g++ -g -c utils.cpp
g++ -o exe main.o macs.o shapes.o hormigas.o NDominatedSet.o aco.o utils.o

To run:

./exe rocio1 salida 1 10 10 0.1 0.2 0.5 0.4 0.5 0

rocio1 is a toy graph I was playing with...

Don't hesitate to ask if you have any problem.

Regards,
Rocio.

========================================================================================
FORMAT OF THE INPUT FILE
========================================================================================

- It is a list of graphs, in the subdue format.
- The edges have to be sorted using only already known nodes (1-2 2-4 4-6, ...)
- The size of the dataset (# of != nodes, # of != links) have to be indicated on the command line
- No loop
- Strings allowed (for the identification of the nodes and the links), but if only one kind of links, we have to use the same string (for instance, "")
- To use a graph with undirected links, we have to add them two times (u 1 2 and u 2 1)
- A new line separate each graph in the file. At the end, there is two new line.
