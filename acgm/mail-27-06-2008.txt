Hello,

Here I send you the AcGM code. It's very easy to run:

acgm -subgraph -in DB.acgm -sup 0.0000001 -out

The sup is for the support, a number between 0-1 but 0 is not interpreted so I
give that :P. The code is not open, it's IBM's now... The oputput is very
strange but its quite easy, the info is in the .zip. The results does not
includes the instances just the number of instances, but there is a code
somewhere to get them, I'll search for it.

I also include a script to transform between subdue input files to acgm input
files.

Have fun!
Rocio.

==================================================

Beware! AcGM input file must have the nodes in order.

Hello,

I couldn't help trying... I converted Arnaud's bigfile2.dat to the AcGM format
and it crashes like my GO experiement... the dataset is too big for AcGM...

Oscar, do I forget about shapes then? AcGM will win surely...

Rocio.

==================================================

Hello!

Here is the new script to convert subdue to acgm. This new version sorts the
nodes and reduces the number of characters per node label to avoid problems.
Any way it still cracks... not enough memory. You can try in your machine but
I don't think it will get any better.

Cheers!
Rocio.
