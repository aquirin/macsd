Hi, friends!

Find attached the Excel sheet format where the C metric values from our MACSD experiments
have to be dropped in order Sergio can perform the statistical test. Notice that:

1) you only have to fill the "valor de C" cells, the "probabilidad de dominancia" ones are
automatically computed according to the dominance threshold value in cell M1.

2) You can import the data from the output files of the algorithms in csv style.

If there is any doubt, just ask me! Cheers,

Oscar.
